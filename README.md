## Stack

The website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) (which are both great).

I took a lot of inspiration from [eleventy-base-blog](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy-base-blog) and [eleventy-excellent](https://github.com/madrilene/eleventy-excellent) for the codebase.

The side notes are based on [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/) and the custom markdown parser is heavily based [on 11d.im's code](https://11d.im/notices/md-tufte/).

I use the [lucide icon set](https://lucide.dev/).
