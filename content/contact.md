If you'd like some prompts and suggestions, here are the topics I'm the most intrigued in at the moment:
1. How did you find me in the first place?
2. What do you enjoy most about my posts (and perhaps videos)? What resonates the most with you?
3. Is there any specific topic I write about you're particularly invested in? Is there anything in particular you'd be interested to see me cover?
4. Have you any ideas on who else might be a good fit for my content and where I might find them?
