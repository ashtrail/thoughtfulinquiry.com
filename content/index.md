Welcome!

Thoughtful Inquiry is a blog about using discernment to experience more fulfillment. It's based on the premise that greater understanding leads to better decisions. As such, it seeks to compile a holistic blend of the best mindsets, frameworks and practices to adopt in the key areas of life. It opts for an integrative approach, aiming to balance the rigor and reliability of objectivity with the source of meaning and values found in subjectivity.
