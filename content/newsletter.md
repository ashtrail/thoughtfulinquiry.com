    Dec 18, 2023 – New post on finding meaning in hindsight
  </summary>

  Hey guys,

  I just published a new post on the blog: [Everything serves a purpose in hindsight](https://www.thoughtfulinquiry.com/blog/everything-serves-a-purpose-in-hindsight/). I kept it pretty short to be sure to get out something before the end December, but I already have another one in the pipes.

  I hope it'll spark ideas or at least make for decent entertainment.

  Take care,

  Arthur

    Feb 02, 2024 – New post: Too skeptical to disbelieve
  </summary>

  Hey guys,

  I just published a new post on the blog: [Too skeptical to disbelieve](https://www.thoughtfulinquiry.com/blog/too-skeptical-to-disbelieve/). It's not the big one I've been working on since December, this one's pretty short. I just got hit with a sudden burst of inspiration for it a few days ago, and since I could finish it far quicker, I thought I might as well publish it before going back to my current white whale.

  Don't worry I've finished the draft and only the editing/proofreading's left so it should be coming in a couple of weeks max. It's gotten quite long despite my attempts at brevity.

  I should be changing my publication strategy going forward and focusing more on shorter posts to improve my frequency and reduce the existential roller coaster of long posts.

  In any case, I hope this new post will be thought-provoking or at least make for some honest entertainment.

  Take care,

  Arthur

    Mar 01, 2024 – New post: What it can spark isn't always bound by what it is
  </summary>

  Hey guys,

  I finally published the big post I've been working on since December: [What it can spark isn't always bound by what it is](https://www.thoughtfulinquiry.com/blog/what-it-can-spark-isnt-always-bound-by-what-it-is/).

  It's about the importance of making fair, nuanced, and transparent assessments when evaluating the worth of a conceptual framework.

  I hope the post itself can spark some insight, or at least make for decent entertainment.

  Take care,

  Arthur
