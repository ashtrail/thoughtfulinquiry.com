title: About the Author
---

My name is Arthur. I'm {% authorAge %} years old. I was born and live in France, so French is my mother tongue, but I'm fluent in English thanks to my Canadian mother. Since I enjoy writing in both languages, I chose the latter to have a broader reach.

I do all the writing, designing, and programming on this website.

If I had to describe what I do, I guess I'd say I'm a professional overthinker with an artistic streak and expertise in dabbling. If that's too open for your taste and you must insist on some more tangible credentials, I have a degree in computer programming and most of my work experience so far has been centered on web development. I also studied psychology a little at some point.

Look up my [contact information](/contact) if you'd like to get in touch.
