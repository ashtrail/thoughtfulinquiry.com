title: Personality Typology Resources
---

A concise repository of the best resources I've found regarding the various personality typology systems I enjoy.

This page is a work in progress, I'll add more systems and content with time.

## MBTI

If you're brand new to the MBTI I'd recommend starting with [Personality Junkie](https://personalityjunkie.com)'s introductory posts:
- [Personality Type Basics (Typology 101) ](https://personalityjunkie.com/typology-101/)
- [The 8 Functions: Roles, Images & Characteristics (Typology 201)](https://personalityjunkie.com/functions-ni-ti-fi-si-ne-te-fe-se/)
- [The “Functional Stack” (Typology 301)](https://personalityjunkie.com/functional-stack-type-dynamics-theory/)

It's a good typology blog overall, so don't hesitate to check out more of their content.

You might also be interested in my this video on [deducing the cognitive functions from a 4 letter type and conversely](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDSWY1kr4vU).

To learn the types, I'd recommend [Michael Pierce's playlist on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zdwGmkc9brI&list=PL6rzdODmcL65kvRx1us3UXkxWclo-LJ_h&pp=iAQB). His YouTube channel is a good place to learn more about the MBTI in general once you've got the basics down.

If you're looking for something a bit more arcane and obscure, I enjoy [Skimmerlit's channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-ySrhaOTg0&list=PLapyHb3ibDRXM5PjMODG8oPx58cL9gST-&pp=iAQB) for original insights on the topic.

**Bonus tip:** If you're an INTP
- Buy and read [The INTP](https://personalityjunkie.com/intp-book-personality-careers-relationships-truth-meaning/) + [The INTP Quest](https://personalityjunkie.com/intp-quest-book/) bundle. Especially, if you're still fairly young (late teens / early twenties) and feel somewhat lost. They're two short e-books of concentrated guidance and recommendations from an older version of yourself. Trust me, for 10 dollars, it's one of the best returns on investment you'll ever make. Thank me later.
- Once you've read the basic theory and a couple of INTP profile descriptions, watch these videos:
  - [INTP Relationship Problems 1 -- Definition as Contract (INTP)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dLP5edjS_3I)
  - [INTP Relationship Problems 2 -- Bipolarity (INTP)](https://youtu.be/neoDb6NTDL4)
