This is the second version of a YouTube comment I initially wrote in response to [the following comment thread](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8H4_dz1_jY&lc=Ugwf13K3qoUqfjZc_CJ4AaABAg) on Dr K's video "Why Your Choices Aren't Really Yours."

I repurposed it as a YouTube video that you can find [here](https://youtu.be/zNDPuB64Ucs).

Man, I'm pissed I wrote a long and passionate rant yesterday evening and it has completely disappeared. Lesson learned don't trust the Youtube comment editor. Guess I'll have to Groundhog Day myself into rewriting it from memory.

Thanks for pointing this out @miramalverick2767, it freaks me out how so many people seem to completely either not realize or care about this implication. Even Dr K who's got a mind for these types of things doesn't seem to compute this dreadful existential conclusion seeing how he's all chipper about the potential death of free will in this video.

It seems a lot of people are eager to jump on the determinism bandwagon in the comments because it relieves them of the concept of merit and with it blame and guilt, but they don't seem to realize that they're shattering the possibility of purpose in the process. To be honest I don't care that much about merit, and even less about self-flagellation. Determinism or not I don't believe in punitive justice but I'm not willing to trade agency in exchange for its obliteration. That sacrifice is unnecessary to reach a similar outcome.

I also feel a bit frustrated that many of the arguments in favor of complete/hard determinism I've read, even the most thoughtful ones, seem to completely miss the main point of contention that @miramalverick2767 and @TheNaruto123 seem to share with me.

It's fine to think that determinism is most likely the truth, but at least honestly contend with the weight of the implication. It seems that people indeed have incredibly different thought processes since it appears some people can make peace with a deterministic reality based on what they say, but I can't conceive how they manage for the life of me.

I agree that the complete absence of free will if it were true would be far worse than nihilism (i.e. the complete absence of meaning). As long as *true* freedom exists, as in the possibility to change destiny based on your decisions and actions, i.e. the possibility of divergent futures, you can still create meaning out of thin air through sheer will. By choosing one thing over another, by sacrificing one for another you can imbue it with meaning. You can make a statement of self-determination and self-expression. It makes choices *significant* because you crafted a specific future instead of another one through your struggle. Freedom of thought and self-sovereignty are the last refuge in the face of all the bullshit of the world, even faced with utter tyranny and oppression, even if God exists and happens to be a massive dickhead, as long as you have real free will you can find salvation in owning your inner judgments and assert who you are through the choice of assent or dissent even if otherwise utterly powerless.

This concept gets tricky because it's easy to play around with definitions, even if there is only one way things can happen you're still affecting the future with your choices, it's just that you could only have ever made the specific choice you made. There is only one future. No choice has purposeful significance. They are simply unavoidable. Humans aren't subjects anymore, but not quite objects either. They are sobjects, the worst combination possible. They have no true agency, they are no different from a leaf blown by wind, but they have to witness it nonetheless and have enough self-awareness to realize how utterly dispossessed they truly are. Even "chosen" death is just playing along for the game. There's is no escape. Utter and absolute subjugation.

So far the determinist answers I have seen don't seem to acknowledge the gravitas of this conception. I'm sorry but "Just jump on the hedonistic treadmill bro, you can still enjoy the ride as an NPC" isn't good enough for me. Nor is distorting the true spirit behind the concept of free will to contort its broken bones within the framing of determinism. "Free will is when you're not being externally coerced". That's consent, not free will. "Free will is when you make a choice that aligns with your values". That's congruence, not free will. Sure consent and congruence are very nice don't get me wrong, but they are not what we care about in this debate. That meager pittance of "compatibilism" feels more like a spit in the face than an attempt at comfort to people who value genuine agency and purpose above anything else.

Anyways, with all that said I have not succumbed to despair. I roughly agree with @kresovk5, the conclusion isn't a done deal. Determinism, although it seems more likely based on our current scientific understanding, isn't proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. The experiments cited still leave room for the existence of free will. There are a few open hypotheses that could make room for free will, but frankly, that's secondary in my opinion.

Plus, I think that there's often a false dilemma between 100% determinacy (= only one "destiny" = no true free will) and 100% indeterminacy (= complete random chaos = no true free will). As long as "branching" causality, where one can decide between a couple of options informed by previous cause and in so doing "shift the tracks of destiny" a smidge, "free will" is still possible. Even if the vast majority of choices are made "automatically", as long as few slivers of opportunities to shift things towards a different outcome survive, true free will isn't dead.

If one is to find solace in this conundrum, I don't think it will come from desperately clinging to the possibility of quantic shenanigans in the brain. That's still rooted in reliance on some external absolute certainty that's not really achievable anyway (at least not for the moment).

I think the best option is to acknowledge the options, and recognize that determinism is a very plausible hypothesis but reject it nonetheless. Not as an appeal to some imaginary authority that takes all responsibility for what we decide to believe away, but as a necessary act of existential survival and rebellion. Seeing how we can't know for sure if we shift our goal from absolute certainty to pragmatic quality of life, we can still make a rational decision in opting for free will. I don't think it's hypocritical, since it's a conscious and owned decision rather than burying one's head in the sand. And in my opinion, it definitely beats the hypocrisy of accepting complete determinism intellectually, but living every instant of your life as if you can shape your future and your choices are significant.
