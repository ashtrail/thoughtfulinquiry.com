title: Privacy policy
---

This website currently does not collect any of your data. It doesn't make use of cookies either. There is only one piece of information stored in your browser's localStorage for the entire site, which is your favorite theme (i.e. light or dark) if you toggle it manually.

As a heads-up, I intend to add some anonymous analytics via [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com/) soon. They won't track any personal data and will only be used to monitor page traffic and optimize the user experience^[By making sure that the display's responsiveness works correctly for most users' screen resolutions, for instance.].

Similarly, I plan to add a newsletter subscription form at some point, which will collect e-mail addresses on opt-in.

If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you can [contact me]({{ metadata.author.contact }}).

I reserve the right to make changes to this policy. Any update will become effective as soon as it's posted on this page.
