The now page serves as a monthly log of what I'm up to regarding the blog. It's a less fleeting medium than a message here and there on social media or an email newsletter+[I discovered the concept from [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/now).].

It's a way to share what I'm working on in the background and keep readers posted on what I'm planning in the short term. It's also a way to update the website here and there in between long-winded posts.

## Roadmap

My next main projects for 2023 are the following+[Though be warned, I have a bad track record when it comes to estimations. Almost everything takes longer than you'd expect.]:

1. âœ… ~~Finishing my empathic inquiry series.~~
2. Start publishing a manifesto series describing the general philosophy and positions of this blog. In order to maintain a sense of diversity (for the readers as well as myself), I plan to publish one of the six posts of the manifesto, then a standalone, and rinse and repeat until I'm done with all of them.
3. Launching a newsletter. For the moment, it'll mostly be to keep people who don't use RSS feeds updated on new posts, but I intend to improve upon it with time.

## 2023

### September 2023

This is the month when I created this Now page. Other than that, it was mostly dedicated to the second half of my empathic inquiry series. It was slow-going, especially to get the momentum started. It led me to refresh my NonViolent Communication theory and get further radicalized into nonviolence as a whole ðŸ˜…. In any case, I finished the first draft at the beginning of October, so it should be out before November, but I still need to edit and proofread it. It stands at about 5,500 words currently.

Spending so much time on such long posts has got me considering diversifying my format. I may publish shorter ones centered on a single concept from time to time to increase my publication frequency and get a breather in between my more ambitious writing marathons.

I've also started reading the second edition of _Internal Family Systems Therapy_ by Richard Schwartz & Martha Sweezy on the side. I'm about halfway into it and really loving it so far. IFS is probably going to become a new staple of my conceptual toolbelt.

### August 2023

Almost all of my work on this blog has been focused on fleshing out the outlines for the six posts of my manifesto series. I'm now on its third iteration and I wanted to submit a complete outline of the whole thing for feedback in order to avoid starting everything over again in the future^[Imagine finding a cataclysmic flaw in the fifth draft after having published four posts and having to reset all progress ðŸ˜°.].

This project has been the throughline of the blog from the start, but I don't have anything to show for all the work I've invested in it so far (publicly, at least). I want to get it right before I start publishing it, and it's a heckin' chonker.

In any case, with that done, I'm free to get back to the second and final post of my empathic inquiry series. I already have a decently fleshed-out outline for it, though realistically, it's not coming out before mid-September at the very best. These babies are quite the time investment, usually around 20 hours of work minimum for a 3500-word post.

I'm a little anxious about the feedback on my outlines. I'm not sure how many more rewrites I'm going to have to go through before I can finally start yeeting the damn thing from the nest.

### July 2023

I published this blog on July 2, 2023, an endeavor I had seriously started working on since February of the same year and had been daydreaming about for about three years.

I also proofread a post on setting up a simple exercise routine, which took much more time than I'd have thought. The whole thing was already written, so I assumed it would be done in a jiffy. Little did I know I'd spend twelve hours editing it. Guess my writing standards have already become more stringent since last year.
