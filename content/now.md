The now page serves as a monthly log of what I'm up to regarding the blog. It's a less fleeting medium than a message here and there on social media or an email newsletter+[I discovered the concept from [Maggie Appleton's digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/now).].

It's a way to share what I'm working on in the background and keep readers posted on what I'm planning in the short term. It's also a way to update the website here and there in between long-winded posts.

## Roadmap

My next main projects for 2023 are the following+[Though be warned, I have a bad track record when it comes to estimations. Almost everything takes longer than you'd expect.]:

1. <span class="completed">âœ… Finishing my empathic inquiry series.</span>
2. Start publishing a manifesto series describing the general philosophy and positions of this blog. In order to maintain a sense of diversity (for the readers as well as myself), I plan to publish one of the six posts of the manifesto, then a standalone, and rinse and repeat until I'm done with all of them.
3. <span class="completed">âœ… Launching a newsletter. For the moment, it'll mostly be to keep people who don't use RSS feeds updated on new posts, but I intend to improve upon it with time.</span>

## 2023

### December 2023

December was quite the month for this blog (and yours truly). Besides publishing my first very short post and starting the draft for my next big one, I was struck with a lightning streak of epiphanies regarding my personal history, a good amount of my behavior patterns, as well as who I'm trying to reach, and what I'm trying to accomplish with this blog and how they all relate to each other.

As it so happens, the final puzzle piece of this specific enigma happened to be identifying my [fearful avoidant attachment style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_theory#Fearful-avoidant) and how it pertains to childhood emotional wounds of being misunderstood, alienated, and peremptorily judged^[Definitely can't have anything to do with my mania regarding the importance of thoughtfulness, nuance, fairness, and the validation of subjective experiences.].

It unlocked a new spring of clarity on what I do, why I do it, and who I do it for. I've further refined my "niche"^[Now that I've found mine, the word doesn't seem as repulsive to me as it used to. But you can replace it with any of these more romantic and inspiring alternatives: purpose, calling, dharma, ikigai, or any other similar term you favor.] from "seeking fulfillment through the balance of rationality and subjectivity" to "providing hope, purpose & support for skeptics who want to believe". The same goes for the archetype I'm trying to embody, namely that of the intellectual swashbuckler, who disarms ideological bullies with flair and steals from the certainty rich to give to the certainty poor and downtrodden.

I won't dive into the details right now. These concepts deserve some individualized and in-depth elaboration, whereas these updates are supposed to be broad and short. However, I should start to make some changes in how I describe this website and what it centers around pretty soon.

Discovering George Kao's and Tad Hargrave's work (respectively, [Authentic Marketing](https://www.georgekao.com/) and [Marketing for Hippies](https://marketingforhippies.com/)) was a huge help during this process. I very warmly and heartily recommend their work. They managed to transmute my unending supply of existential dread and contempt towards marketing into inspiration and stimulation. Had you told me I'd become amenable to entrepreneurship a month ago, I would have scoffed. Those are some impressive outlook judo moves.

Although, just to be clear, it didn't change the vast majority of my previously held sentiments. Most of the concepts and strategies peddled under the guise of marketing and business these days are still 100% morally defunct gag-reflex inducing utter soulless trash. I've simply realized they're not the only way to go at it.

In other news, I also enjoyed a vacation for the end-of-year holidays with my close family, which is always a great time. It also served as yet another opportunity for shared introspective insights.

### November 2023

In November, I created the first version of my newsletter with [Mailerlite](https://www.mailerlite.com/). For the moment, I'll only use it to send updates on new posts, but I should expand its scope with time. I spent the rest of the month iterating on my manifesto outlines, but preliminary feedback leads me to believe they're still a long way from being ready. I'd be quite surprised (and disappointed) if I still haven't published anything on that front by the end of 2024, but I definitely won't manage to squeeze it in before the end of the current year.

In any case, there are too many unknowns regarding this project, so I won't commit to any definite date and allocate some of my time to other posts in order to keep a semiregular rhythm of publication. I'm going to try to pick something shorter than usual and hopefully, I'll manage to get it out sometime in December. No promises though.

On an unrelated topic, my latest TTRPG rabbit hole on the side is still going strong. I've also started trying a few really nifty Mac productivity applications, namely [Hookmark](https://hookproductivity.com/), which lets you create links and connect almost anything on your Mac like files and emails, [Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/), a launcher like spotlight but on steroids^[Probably my favorite of the lot, it'd already be worth it if all it had going for itself was its built-in calculator which includes currency and timezone conversions, but there's a whole lot more.], and [Arc](https://arc.net/), a browser with a couple of innovating and user-friendly concepts^[...and a concerning lack of business plan]. You can find overviews for each of them on YouTube to get a feel for what they can do. If you use a Mac, I'd definitely recommend at least giving them a try.

### October 2023

Most of this month was dedicated to finishing up and editing my draft for [Resolving conflict through constructive empathic inquiry]({{- collections.posts | getURLByFileSlug('2023-10_constructive-empathic-inquiry')}}). All in all, it took me a decent amount of time (about 20 hours in October), but it's finally done.

This means I'm now free to start working on my next two goals for the year starting in November, namely creating a very basic newsletter to serve as an alternative to my RSS feeds and going back to work on my manifesto outlines. The latter is made up of two trilogies, and although the second is mostly fine, I need to do a good bit of restructuring on the first one to make its content more digestible. To be honest, based on my pace so far, I highly doubt I'll have the first post published before the end of the year.

In completely unrelated news, a succession of fortuitous triggers (including the [D&D actual play](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHv5CBoZYv4VQSb6e64P4e4gUXrgNsgq5) from *Baldur's Gate 3*'s voice actors cast) has rekindled my passion for tabletop role-playing games, which hadn't been this fierce for at least two good years. So my sleep schedule scourge of the month has been feverishly reading PDF rule books (mostly [SWADE](https://peginc.com/new-to-savage-worlds-start-here/) related), learning [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/), and binge-watching [Matthew Colville](https://www.youtube.com/@mcolville) and [Me, Myself and Die](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDvunq75UfH_GAUWYcYSGL_vftZG0nzR-) videos, to name only a few of the main offenders.

### September 2023

This is the month when I created this Now page. Other than that, it was mostly dedicated to the second half of my empathic inquiry series. It was slow-going, especially to get the momentum started. It led me to refresh my NonViolent Communication theory and get further radicalized into nonviolence as a whole :P. In any case, I finished the first draft at the beginning of October, so it should be out before November, but I still need to edit and proofread it. It stands at about 5,500 words currently.

Spending so much time on such long posts has got me considering diversifying my format. I may publish shorter ones centered on a single concept from time to time to increase my publication frequency and get a breather in between my more ambitious writing marathons.

I've also started reading the second edition of _Internal Family Systems Therapy_ by Richard Schwartz & Martha Sweezy on the side. I'm about halfway into it and really loving it so far. IFS is probably going to become a new staple of my conceptual toolbelt.

### August 2023

Almost all of my work on this blog has been focused on fleshing out the outlines for the six posts of my manifesto series. I'm now on its third iteration and I wanted to submit a complete outline of the whole thing for feedback in order to avoid starting everything over again in the future^[Imagine finding a cataclysmic flaw in the fifth draft after having published four posts and having to reset all progress ðŸ˜°.].

This project has been the throughline of the blog from the start, but I don't have anything to show for all the work I've invested in it so far (publicly, at least). I want to get it right before I start publishing it, and it's a heckin' chonker.

In any case, with that done, I'm free to get back to the second and final post of my empathic inquiry series. I already have a decently fleshed-out outline for it, though realistically, it's not coming out before mid-September at the very best. These babies are quite the time investment, usually around 20 hours of work minimum for a 3500-word post.

I'm a little anxious about the feedback on my outlines. I'm not sure how many more rewrites I'm going to have to go through before I can finally start yeeting the damn thing from the nest.

### July 2023

I published this blog on July 2, 2023, an endeavor I had seriously started working on since February of the same year and had been daydreaming about for about three years.

I also proofread a post on setting up a simple exercise routine, which took much more time than I'd have thought. The whole thing was already written, so I assumed it would be done in a jiffy. Little did I know I'd spend twelve hours editing it. Guess my writing standards have already become more stringent since last year.
